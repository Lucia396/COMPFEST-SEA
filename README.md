# COMPFEST-SEA

## Step-by-step
1. Open 'compfest sea' folder to access file, then open 'app.py' file.
2. Use a virtual environment to access the website, by following these command on your terminal
    - Create an environment by creating a ```.venv``` folder within
      * On macOS/Linux
      ```
      $ cd /path/to/folder
      $ python3 -m venv .venv
      ```
      * On Windows
      ```
      > cd /path/to/folder
      > py -3 -m venv .venv
      ```
    - Activate the environment
      * On macOS/Linux
      ```
      $ . .venv/bin/activate
      ```
